    <description><![CDATA[This is a extension package that provides helper functions installed as a Chocolatey extension.
These functions may be used in Chocolatey install/uninstall scripts by declaring this package a dependency in your package's nuspec.
This package provides helper functions that can be used to enhance what is already available out of the box with Chocolatey CLI.
This includes both features that are being tested for Chocolatey CLI itself, and other helpers to make the maintenance of
Chocolatey packages easier.

Helpers that were available in this package, and were later added to Chocolatey CLI, will be moved to
the package [chocolatey-compatibility.extension](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey-compatibility.extension).

Backwards compatibility is not considered for helpers available in this package, see the Notes below.

## Notes

- There is [a known bug](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-extensions/issues/11) in the function `Get-AppInstallLocation` with parameter `$AppNamePattern` which is internally used both as wildcard and regex patterns. This usually doesn't create any problems, but may do so if application contains regex symbols in the name, such as [notepad++](https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-coreteampackages/issues/1198).
- This package itself is not concerned with keeping backwards compatibility with Chocolatey CLI. If compatibility is of concern, instead take a dependency on [chocolatey-compatibility.extension](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey-compatibility.extension).
